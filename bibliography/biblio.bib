  description = {Genome-wide single-gene deletion libraries can be important tools for understanding the molecular workings of an organism, but have only been created for a single eukaryotic species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Now, Kim et al. present a second collection of deletion mutants that covers 98.4% of the genes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, allowing a systematic comparison of gene essentiality and knockout phenotypes between two eukaryotic species.},
